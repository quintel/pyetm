# pyetm

This package provides a set of tools for interaction with the Energy Transition Model's API. Learn more
about the Energy Transition Model [here](https://energytransitionmodel.com/). The
package is designed to be a modular tool that advanced users can incorporate into their scenario workflows. The
complete documentation is available [via the ETM documentation page](https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/pyetm/introduction).

## Installation

You can clone pyetm from [our Github](https://github.com/quintel/pyetm). The package is also
available via pip - install it and use it in your project!
```
pip install pyetm
```

## Just running the Jupyter Notebooks - or a beginner friendly guide to PyETM
If you are not planning on developing the tool, but would like to open and run our Jupyter notebooks
in VS Code, follow the beginner friendly guide at [Running notebooks](running_notebooks.md).

## Getting started
Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then, install all required
libraries by opening a terminal/command-prompt window in the `pyetm` folder (or navigate to this folder
in the terminal using `cd "path/to/pytem-folder"`). All following examples of running the tool
expect you to be in this folder.

#### Using pipenv
It is recommended (but not required) that you use [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for
running these tools. When using `pipenv` it will create a virtual environment for you. A virtual
environment helps with keeping the libraries you install here separate of your global libraries (in
other words your `pyetm` will be in a stable and isolated environment and are thus less
likely to break when updating things elsewhere on your computer).

You can install `pipenv` with `pip` or `pip3` if you don't have it installed yet.
```
pip3 install pipenv
```

Then you can create a new environment and install all the libraries in one go by running:
```
pipenv install
```

If you plan to develop with the tool, install the dev dependencies too:
```
pipenv install --dev
```

#### Configuring your settings

You can set your API token and the base url for your requests (depending which
[environment](https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/api/intro#environments) you want to interact with)
either directly in the ENV or via a config.yml file.

##### config.yml
pyetm uses a `config.yml` file in the project root to store your personal settings:

1. Duplicate the example file provided (`examples/config.example.yml`) and rename it to `config.yml`.
2. Open `config.yml` and fill in your values:
   - **etm_api_token**: Your personal ETM API token (overridden by the `$ETM_API_TOKEN` environment variable if set).
   - **base_url**: The API base URL for the target environment (overridden by the `$BASE_URL` environment
    variable if set) e.g., default pro, a stable engine at `https://2025-01.engine.energytransitionmodel.com/api/v3`,
    or beta at `https://beta.engine.energytransitionmodel.com/api/v3`.
   - **local_engine_url** and **local_model_url**: URLs for a local ETM instance, if running locally.
   - **proxy_servers**: (Optional) HTTP/HTTPS proxy URLs, if required by your network.
   - **csv_separator** and **decimal_separator**: Defaults are `,` and `.`; adjust if your CSV exports
    use different separators.

Your `config.yml` should reside in the root `pyetm/` folder.

##### ENV variables
If you use pyetm as a package, you may want to set your ENV variables using a custom flow. In that
case, the variables you need to set are:

    $ETM_API_TOKEN - Your api token (specific to the environment you are interacting with)
    $BASE_URL - The base url of the environment you are interacting with.
    $LOCAL_ENGINE_URL - The local url of the engine if running locally.
    $LOCAL_MODEL_URL - The local url of the model if running locally.
